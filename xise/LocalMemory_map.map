ERROR:Pack:2309 - Too many bonded comps of type "IOB" found to fit this device.
ERROR:Map:237 - The design is too large to fit the device.  Please check the Design Summary section to see which resource requirement for
   your design exceeds the resources available in the device. Note that the number of slices reported may not be reflected accurately as
   their packing might not have been completed.

Interim Summary
---------------
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                 6,154 out of 106,400    5%
    Number used as Flip Flops:               6,154
    Number used as Latches:                      0
    Number used as Latch-thrus:                  0
    Number used as AND/OR logics:                0
  Number of Slice LUTs:                      1,928 out of  53,200    3%
    Number used as logic:                    1,928 out of  53,200    3%
      Number using O6 output only:           1,672
      Number using O5 output only:               0
      Number using O5 and O6:                  256
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of  17,400    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:      0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        7,823
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         1,669 out of   7,823   21%
    Number with an unused LUT:               5,895 out of   7,823   75%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         259 out of   7,823    3%
    Number of unique control sets:               4
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               6 out of 106,400    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
